Next starter for creating a blog with Strapi.

This starter allows you to try Strapi with Next with the example of a simple blog. It is fully customizable and due to the fact that it is open source, fully open to contributions. Do not hesitate to add new features etc ...

You may want to know how to develop such a starter by your own! This starter is actually the result of this [tutorial](https://strapi.io/blog/build-a-blog-with-next-react-js-strapi-and-apollo) **but without using Apollo**
